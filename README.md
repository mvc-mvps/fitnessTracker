# Fitlyfe 4 Life

## Description

We decided to create the Fitlyfe 4 Life application because we noticed that there isn't any other exercise and nutrition apps that will allow users to create their own workout and nutrition plan from scratch. For those that are trying lose or gain weight, eat better, and complete their health goals, downloading the Fitlyfe 4 Life application would be the best choice. 

When individuals that have never played sports or worked out before, they don't know where to start. Fitlyfe 4 Life allows the user to create a goal setting planner that focuses on the specific exercises of their choice and calculates the total number of calories from the food items they have added on the nutrition page.

This is something like an all-in-one application. Instead of using one app to follow workouts given by instructors or writing down your workouts on a piece of paper, having this ability to keep track of both workouts and food intake will allow the user to focus on their goals in one app. Once you complete your workouts they will be added to a progress bar where you can see what you have done over time.
